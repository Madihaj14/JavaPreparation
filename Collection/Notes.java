     * Difference between Collection API, Collection and Collections
     * Collection API is a framework that provides architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects.
     * Collection is a root interface in the Collection API that represents a group of objects.
     * Collections is a utility class that provides static methods for operating on collections.
     * Uses of Collections class include sorting, searching, and shuffling elements in a collection.
     * Why Collection is an interface and Collections is a class?
     * Collection is an interface because it defines a contract for a group of objects without providing implementation.
     * Collections is a class because it provides concrete implementations of utility methods for collections.
     * Collections class is final, meaning it cannot be subclassed.
     * Collections class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it is meant to be used in a static context.
     * Collections class provides static methods that operate on or return collections, such as sorting and searching.
     * Collections class is part of the java.util package, which contains the Collection API.
     * Collections class is designed to work with the Collection interface and its subinterfaces, such as List, Set, and Queue.
     * Collections class provides methods that can be used with any implementation of the Collection interface, such
     * as ArrayList, HashSet, and LinkedList.
     * Collections class provides methods that can be used with any type of object, as it uses
