     * Difference between Collection API, Collection and Collections
     * Collection API is a framework that provides architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects.
     * Collection is a root interface in the Collection API that represents a group of objects.
     * Collections is a utility class that provides static methods for operating on collections.
     * Uses of Collections class include sorting, searching, and shuffling elements in a collection.
     * Why Collection is an interface and Collections is a class?
     * Collection is an interface because it defines a contract for a group of objects without providing implementation.
     * Collections is a class because it provides concrete implementations of utility methods for collections.
     * Collections class is final, meaning it cannot be subclassed.
     * Collections class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, as it is meant to be used in a static context.
     * Collections class provides static methods that operate on or return collections, such as sorting and searching.
     * Collections class is part of the java.util package, which contains the Collection API.
     * Collections class is designed to work with the Collection interface and its subinterfaces, such as List, Set, and Queue.
     * Collections class provides methods that can be used with any implementation of the Collection interface, such
     * as ArrayList, HashSet, and LinkedList.
     * Collections class provides methods that can be used with any type of object, as it uses

     /* 
      * ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface.
      * It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order.
        * ArrayList provides dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.
        * It is part of the java.util package and implements the List interface.
        * ArrayList is not synchronized, making it unsuitable for concurrent access.
        * ArrayList allows random access to elements using an index.
        * ArrayList provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
        * ArrayList is more efficient for storing and accessing data compared to traditional arrays.
        * ArrayList is commonly used in scenarios where dynamic resizing and frequent access to elements are required.
        * ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework, which provides a set of classes and interfaces for working with collections of objects.
        * ArrayList is implemented as a resizable array, which means that it can grow or shrink in size as needed.
        * ArrayList is not synchronized, which means that it is not thread-safe. If multiple
        * threads access an ArrayList concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be synchronized externally.
        * ArrayList provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, as well as for
        * iterating over the elements in the list.
        * ArrayList is commonly used in scenarios where dynamic resizing and frequent access to elements are required,
        * such as in applications that require a flexible data structure for storing and manipulating data.
