    //Stacks in Java Collections Framework (JCF)
    /*
    1. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
    2. In a stack, the element that is added last is the one to be removed first.
    3. Java provides a built-in Stack class as part of the java.util package.
    4. The Stack class extends the Vector class and provides various methods to perform stack operations.
    5. Some commonly used methods of the Stack class are:
        a. push(): to add an element to the top of the stack
        b. pop(): to remove and return the top element of the stack
        c. peek(): to view the top element of the stack without removing it
        d. isEmpty(): to check if the stack is empty
        e. search(): to search for an element in the stack and return its position from the top
     */

    /*
    Example usage of Stack class is shown below.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Push elements onto the stack
        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);

        // Peek at the top element
        System.out.println("Top element is: " + stack.peek());

        // Pop elements from the stack
        System.out.println("Popped element is: " + stack.pop());

        // Check if the stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.isEmpty());

        // Search for an element in the stack
        System.out.println("Position of 20 in stack is: " + stack.search(20));
