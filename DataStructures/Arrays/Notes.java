    // This is a note about arrays in Java.
    /*
    An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
    The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
    This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
    In Java, arrays are objects that dynamically allocate memory.
    They can hold primitive data types as well as objects.
    1. Declaration and Initialization:
       - You can declare an array using the syntax: `dataType[] arrayName;`
       - To initialize an array, you can use: `arrayName = new dataType[size];` or `dataType[] arrayName = {value1, value2, ...};`
    2. Accessing Elements:
       - Elements in an array can be accessed using their index, starting from 0. For example, `arrayName[0]` accesses the first element.
    3. Length of an Array:
       - You can find the length of an array using `arrayName.length`.
    4. Multidimensional Arrays:
       - Java supports multidimensional arrays, which can be declared as `dataType[][] arrayName;`. 
         - They can be initialized similarly, e.g., `dataType[][] arrayName = new dataType[rows][columns];`
    5. Common Operations:
       - Iterating through an array using loops (for, enhanced for).
       - Modifying elements by accessing them via their index.
       - Copying arrays using `System.arraycopy()` or `Arrays.copyOf()`.
       - Sorting arrays using `Arrays.sort()`.
       - Searching for elements using `Arrays.binarySearch()`.
    6. Limitations:
       - Arrays have a fixed size once initialized. To create a dynamic array, consider using `ArrayList` from the `java.util` package.
    7. Example:
       ```java
         int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(numbers[i]);
            }
         ```    
    8. Important Methods from `java.util.Arrays`:
       - `Arrays.toString(array)`: Returns a string representation of the array.
         - `Arrays.equals(array1, array2)`: Checks if two arrays are equal.
         - `Arrays.fill(array, value)`: Fills the array with the specified value.
    9. Best Practices:
       - Always check the bounds when accessing array elements to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
    10. Performance:
       - Arrays provide fast access to elements using indices, making them suitable for scenarios where quick lookups are required.
    11. Memory Considerations:
       - Since arrays are objects, they are stored in the heap memory, and their size is fixed upon creation.
       - Be mindful of the memory usage, especially with large arrays, as they can consume significant amounts of heap space.
    12. Array vs. ArrayList:
       - Arrays are of fixed size, while `ArrayList` can dynamically resize.
    13. Common Exceptions:
       - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Thrown when trying to access an index outside the bounds of the array.
    14. Multidimensional Arrays:
       - Can be jagged (arrays of arrays) or rectangular (all rows have the same length).
    15. Cloning Arrays:
       - You can clone an array using the `clone()` method, which creates a shallow copy of the array.
    16. Varargs:
       - Java supports variable-length arguments (varargs) using the syntax `dataType... var Name`, which allows passing a variable number of arguments to a method.
    17. Enhanced for Loop:
       - Java provides an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate over arrays easily: `for (dataType item : arrayName) { // use item }`
    18. Arrays as Method Parameters:
       - Arrays can be passed to methods as parameters, allowing methods to operate on multiple values.
    19. Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the last element is at index length-1.
    20. Arrays can hold both primitive data types (int, char, etc.) and reference types (objects).
    21. Java provides utility methods in the `java.util.Arrays` class for common array operations like sorting, searching, and comparing arrays.
    22. Arrays are mutable, meaning you can change the elements after the array has been created.
    23. When an array is created, all its elements are initialized to default values (0 for numeric types, false for boolean, null for object references).
    24. Arrays can be multidimensional, allowing you to create arrays of arrays (e.g., 2D arrays for matrices).
    25. Java does not support array resizing; to change the size of an array, you need to create a new array and copy the elements.
    26. Arrays can be cloned using the `clone()` method, which creates a shallow copy of the array.
    27. Be cautious when using arrays in multithreaded environments, as they are not synchronized by default.
    28. Java provides the `Arrays` utility class in the `java.util` package, which includes methods for sorting, searching, and manipulating arrays.    
    29. Arrays can be used in conjunction with collections, such as converting an array to a list using `Arrays.asList(array)`.
    30. When passing an array to a method, you are passing a reference to the array, not a copy of the array itself.
    31. Java arrays can be of any type, including user-defined types (classes). 
    32. The `System.arraycopy()` method can be used for efficient copying of array elements from one array to another.

    36. Java arrays can be serialized, allowing them to be easily saved to a file or transmitted over a network.
    37. Java provides the `Arrays.deepToString()` method for printing multidimensional arrays in a readable format.
