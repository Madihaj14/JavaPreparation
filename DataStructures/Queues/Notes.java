     * Queue:
     * A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
     * Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).
     * Here are some key points about Queues:
     1. FIFO Structure: The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
     2. Dynamic Size: Queues can grow and shrink in size as elements are added and removed.
     3. No Random Access: Unlike arrays or lists, you cannot access elements in a queue randomly; you can only access the front element.
     4. Use Cases: Queues are commonly used in scenarios like task scheduling, handling requests in web servers, and breadth-first search (BFS) in graph algorithms.
     5. Variants: There are several variants of queues, including circular queues, priority queues, and double-ended queues (deques).
     6. Implementation: Queues can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures.
     7. Time Complexity: The time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations is O(1) in a well-implemented queue.
     * 
     * Common Operations:
     * 1. enqueue(element): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
     * 2. dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
     * 3. peek(): Returns the front element without removing it.
     * 4. isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
     * 5. size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.
     * 
     * Implementations:
     * - Array-based Queue
     * - Linked List-based Queue
     * - Circular Queue
     * 
     * Use Cases:
     * - Task scheduling
     * - Handling requests in web servers
     * - Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graph algorithms

    /* Additional notes:
        * - Queues can be implemented using various data structures like arrays or linked lists.
        * - Circular queues help in optimizing space by reusing empty slots.
        * - Priority Queues are a special type of queue where elements are dequeued based on priority rather than order of insertion.
